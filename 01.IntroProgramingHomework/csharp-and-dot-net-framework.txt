Difference between C# and .NET Framework

.NET Framework isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.

C#  is class-based programming language. It is using .net library (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
The distinction between a language and runtime and library is more strict in .NET/C# than for example in C++, where the language specification also includes some basic library functions. The C# specification says only a very little about the environment (basically, that it should contain some types such as int, but that's more or less all).
